# ML.net Video Tutorials
This is just my notes etc. for the tutorials I'm hoping to make soon

## Concept
There are few ml.net tutorials out there that is exploring anything interesting, it's more "hey you data scientists, come over here and have a look", or "C# devs, you can to ML too, and be just as cool as the young turtlenecked Python devs". I want to make a bit more "fun" content, that can help people do fun things like aim-bots.
