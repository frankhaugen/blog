# The perfect GitHub Actions setup
In my repository Frank.Libraries I've setup a good workflow of actions. I might have gone a bit over board on the infrastructure for a relativly, at time of writing, tiny library. But I qm anticipating an increase in usage.

## the main setup
- code coverage analysis
- code quality analysis
- dynamic versioning of nugets, (merge to master publish previews, release publish regular)
- everything GitHub can offer in terms of scanning is activated
- branch polices

## Goal for the infrastructure
Having a good workflow for deployment is critical in any software project....
