# Thoughts on time and date in applications

### TL;DR
I'm working on an app requreing a form of timestamp in a chat, and what type of time to use is a big question, so I disquss it here.

### Why is time important?
You might think that for a simple chat app, there's no need to use time, but you should always include time. It's a great way to sort, though this might be acheived by some auto-incremented number.

### What DateTime format to use?
Some examples the same DateTime:
- 10-03-12 12:13AM
- 10-03-12 12:13
- 10-03-2012 12:13
- 2012-40-3 12:13
- 2012-40-4 12:13
